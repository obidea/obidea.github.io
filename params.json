Semantika provides data query and retrieval facilities in SPARQL. It generates optimal SQL calls and relieves end-users from the underlying data schema. Applications using Semantika can serve intuitive data query service over database system with little performance overhead. It is an open-source product under Apache License 2.0.\r\n\r\nSeveral API features:\r\n\r\n1. **Mapping SQL Tables to RDF Graphs**. Semantika uses mapping modelling paradigm R2RML for writing the specification. The formats are available in Turtle and XML.\r\n\r\n2. **Formal Domain Modelling**. Semantika understands domain modelling in OWL and support inferencing of OWL 2 QL profile.\r\n\r\n3. **XML User Configuration**. Users can add/remove setup parameters for data connection, connection pooling and system resources through XML file.\r\n\r\n4. **Data Query in SPARQL**. Semantika promises natural data query using SPARQL expressions. The language is very flexible and schema-free. The algorithm can perform an optimal translation from SPARQL to SQL thus creates a responsive query answering.\r\n\r\n### Semantika.CLI\r\nA Unix-based command line utility for debugging, querying and exporting data. Suppose you want to try immediately the product without troubling yourself with the coding then this utility is the most appropriate.\r\n\r\n### Semantika.Sesame\r\nA SPARQL endpoint for remote query servicing. Suppose you want to provide public access to your database and allowing many users to query the data then this component can be deployed in your server machine and serves query services.\r\n\r\n### Semantika.Big\r\nA conceptual project (still in my sketch book) for storage and large-scale processing of data-sets on commodity hardwares. The project will exploit the powerful Hadoop and Hive framework to replace database system as its backend.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
